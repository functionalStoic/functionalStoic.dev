Each year, the
[Fort Collins FC Moves Department](https://www.fcgov.com/fcmoves/) performs a
survey that generates data about the count of various non-car traffic at
intersections across the city. This includes:

- Bikes
- Skateboards
- Scooters
- One Wheels

To improve precision about the counts, extra criteria was provided to break up
counts by 2 categories:

1. Were they e-powered? i.e. e-Bikes & e-Scooters
2. Was a helmet worn?

These counts are recorded within four 30-minute intervals.

In 2021, I participated by counting at an intersection nearby our home. Our
family often travel by bike / walk by this intersection, so I was happy to
contribute in any way that could make it more safe.

- Site ID: 13
- Location: W Swallow Rd & Meadowlark Ave

Below are the counts we recorded in each 30 minute interval:

Improving bike safety in a community is about many 1% improvements. It was a fun
project to participate in, the kids enjoyed it, and we look forward to
participating next year.
